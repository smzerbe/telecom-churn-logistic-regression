# Telecom Churn Logistic Regression

This project builds a logistic regression model to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on service usage and account attributes. It includes a full data cleaning pipeline, exploratory analysis, model fitting, and evaluation.

---

## Project Overview

- Objective: Predict binary customer churn (`Churn`) using service and demographic features
- Model: Logistic Regression (`statsmodels`)
- Dataset: Telecom dataset containing features such as tenure, service usage, billing, and customer demographics

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic regression modeling using `statsmodels`
- Model diagnostics (confusion matrix, ROC curve, pseudo RÂ²)
- Feature significance interpretation
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`
